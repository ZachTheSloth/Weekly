WHAT IS THIS?

Weekly is a simplistic habit tracking app based on credits. Create a habit by choosing the name of the habit, the number of habit "credits" you want, and how often the credits get refilled. Every time you do that certain action, tap it in the list to remove one credit.

The front-end is built using UIKit, and the data is stored in the backend using CoreData.

SETUP

Weekly is an iOS app built for iOS 12, so XCode 10.2 or later is the only requirement to get it set up and running.
